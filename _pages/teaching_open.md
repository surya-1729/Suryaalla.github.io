## How To Apply

Please read this section carefully. I might not answer you if you do not follow the instructions and I am very busy at the moment (or just reply with a link here).

In order to apply write an email to zorah.laehner@uni-siegen.de with at least the following information:
- a **short** introduction of yourself including your study program and semester
- some kind of acknowledgment that you are aware that I only give out projects related to 3D data and will not ask for a pure image based project (except it is in the list below)
- your transcript of records (this is the list of your courses and grades you can get from Unisono)
- which project you are the most interested in (from the list below, or your own project but only 3D related topics)

Optional but appreciated:
- your CV
- a description of experience you have with handling 3D data
- names of people in the computer vision chair you have worked with before

## Available Projects

Currently available spots: 1 (earliest starting date mid March)

(there are more topics here than available spots but I can only supervise a certain amount of students at the same time, please do not write emails if it says 0 spots available)

All projects related to deep learning need to be implemented in PyTorch (not another framework).

### Fast Marching on a 3D Product Manifold

**Summary** Replace the Dijkstra shortest path implementation in the paper below with fast marching.

**Suitable for** Bachelor Thesis, Studienarbeit

**Requirements** C++, Matlab (brief is fine, the Matlab part does not need to be changed)



### Analysis of PointNet Architecture

**Summary** Analysis of training strategies and extension of the PointNet architecture.

**Suitable for** Bachelor Thesis, Studienarbeit

**Most related paper** [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation, Qi et al, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)

**Requirements** Python, preferably experience with either PyTorch or 3D geometry processing, for Studienarbeit: passed Deep Learning lecture offered in Siegen


### Generation of LEGO Models

**Summary** Automatic generation of buildable LEGO models from a given 3D mesh. This can be both learning based or procedural based on your preferences.

**Suitable for** Master Thesis

sembly Manual from 3D Polygon Model, Ono et al, 2013](https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/1974096800/1974096800.pdf)

**Requirements** Python, passed any lecture related to machine learning, computer vision, or computer graphics offered in Siegen

### Non-Rigid Puzzles

**Summary** Merging and correspondence calculation between multiple non-rigidly deformed shapes of the same object instance (e.g. humans in the same pose, see example paper).

**Suitable for** Master Thesis

**Most related paper** [Spectral Unions of Partial Deformable 3D Shapes, Moschella et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00514)
