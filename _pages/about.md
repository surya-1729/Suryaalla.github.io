I am happy to announce that I will be joining the Computer Science department of the University of Bonn as an assistant professor (tenure track) in January! I will be part of the [Chair for Visual Computing](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/) and the [Lamarr Institute](https://lamarr-institute.org/), and head the Geometry in Machine Learning group.  

As part of my new group I have three open positions to fill (both for PhD students and postdocs). If you are interested in working on Shape Analysis or Geometric Deep Learning with me, send me an email with some information about you!  

Currently, I am a Postdoc at the [Computer Vision  Group](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en){:target="\_blank"} headed by [Prof. Michael Moeller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/) at the University of Siegen since February 2021. Before that I was a PhD student of [Prof. Daniel Cremers](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers){:target="\_blank"} at TU Munich. I am funded through my KI-Starter grant 'Robust Geometric Deep Learning' from the Ministerium für Kultur und Wissenschaft NRW. I received my Computer Science Bachelor's degree from the University of Bonn (in 2013) and my Computer Science Master's degree with distinction from the Technical University Munich (in 2015). During my studies I spend one month (March 2017) at Technion under the supervision of [Prof. Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il){:target="\_blank"} and six months at Facebook Reality Labs under the supervision of [Dr. Tony Tung](https://sites.google.com/site/tony2ng/){:target="\_blank"}. In 2019 I got a DAAD scholarship to spend two months at Sapienza Unversità di Roma with [Prof. Emanuele Rodolà](https://sites.google.com/site/erodola/){:target="\_blank"} and did a three months internship at Toshiba Research Europe under the supervision of [Dr. Roberto Mecca](http://www.robertomecca.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
