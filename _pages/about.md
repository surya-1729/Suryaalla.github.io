I joined the [Computer Vision  Group](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en){:target="\_blank"} headed by [Prof. Michael Moeller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/) at the University of Siegen in February 2021. Before that I was a PhD student of [Prof. Daniel Cremers](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers){:target="\_blank"} at TU Munich. I received my Computer Science Bachelor's degree from the University of Bonn (in 2013) and my Computer Science Master's degree with distinction from the Technical University Munich (in 2015). During my studies I spend one month (March 2017) at Technion under the supervision of [Prof. Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il){:target="\_blank"} and six months at Facebook Reality Labs under the supervision of [Dr. Tony Tung](https://sites.google.com/site/tony2ng/){:target="\_blank"}. In 2019 I got a DAAD scholarship to spend two months at Sapienza Unversità di Roma with [Prof. Emanuele Rodolà](https://sites.google.com/site/erodola/){:target="\_blank"} and did a three months internship at Toshiba Research Europe under the supervision of [Dr. Roberto Mecca](http://www.robertomecca.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Research Interests

I am interested in anything related to 3D Shape Analysis, especially Shape Matching and Modeling. I also work on realistic and efficient Clothing Animation and Reconstruction.
